        <h2>Hello, Pokémon Trainer!</h2>
        <p>
          If you're seeing this, chances are you're my professor. Hope you enjoy
          exploring my project!
          <br /><br />For my web development exam, I wanted to create something
          original yet technically challenging.<br />This website features a
          fully functional Pokémon battle system, responsive design, animations,
          and a client-side login system using browser storage—all built without
          any backend dependencies.<br /><br />I aimed to push my skills to the
          limit, incorporating everything I could think of while ensuring the
          experience remains immersive and engaging. <br />Thank you for
          checking it out—I hope it meets the high standards of the Pokémon
          League!

        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>
          Since this isn’t a real company, our “team” is actually just me—with
          different pictures. But hey, at least I tried to make it fancy!
